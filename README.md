# Base de Donn√©es

We are a team of researcher, members of the IT Department mandated by a travel agency. Our
team is charged of website settings.
After defining the project framework and his expectations, we only have to look at the creation
of the database.

Thus, during this report, we will have to carry out :

A first conceptual study that have the aim to realize the data conceptual model :

* Creation of the data dictionary gathering all of the columns with their
characteristics

* The functional dependency matrix between each of these

* The data conceptual model composed of entities, keys, relationships and
cardinalities

* The transformation from the conceptual model to the logical model and then
physical model in order to create our database

* The realization of the three expected requests (in form of algebraic threes : 5, 9
and 16).

The action plan will follow the logical order of each steps quoted previously. First, we will
resume the context and the informations we have at our disposal. Secondly, we will realize our
coenceptual model and database, then we will exploit it.
